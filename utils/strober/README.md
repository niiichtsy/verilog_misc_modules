# strober
A simple module which creates a single clock cycle strobe based on a continuous input signal (a single rising edge of the input signal translates to a single strobe).

TODO:
- [ ] Parametrize clock cycle duration of the strobe signal
- [ ] Add optional inferring of an interrupt on the output signal port
